Links to a documentation page for each demo are provided on the following
URL: http://www.freertos.org/a00090.html

Originally this folder contained many demo applicatoins. Each RTOS port has a demo application to demonstrate it's use. I left the one I successfully built CORTEXT_LM3S811_GCC, which is ARM CORTEXT-M3 for evaluate board LM3S811 and building by GCC.

- The Demo/Common directory contains the demo application files as described on
the http://www.FreeRTOS.org WEB site.  Each file creates one or more tasks.
The files in the Demo/Common directory are used by every demo application for
every port.

- All the other directories contain a project or makefile for the demo
application targeted at a particular microcontroller.


For example, if you are interested in the ATMega323 demo application for
the WinAVR tools then the AVR_ATMega323_WinAVR directory contains the
relevant makefile.  The makefile includes files from the Demo/ATMega323
and the Demo/Common directories.  If this is the only port you are
interested in then all the other directories can be ignored.
